# Arduino_SNMP_manager
This adds some SNMP manager functions. Allowing you to send get requests and parse the response.

This is my first time programing so the code is probably a disaster but it works for the task I needed.

I have only tested it for my use case.

generate and send get-requests.
parse response formated in int32.

Other response types like Char and Counter should would but I have not tested any of them.
